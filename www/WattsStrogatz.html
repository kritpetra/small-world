	<h3>Watts-Strogatz Model</h3>
<p class='model_description'>	
	A large residential block has just finished construction. One person each moves into a house, which together spans the entire circumference of the block. On the first day, everybody introduces themselves to their closest neighbors. Then, over the next few weeks, random acquaintances are made as residents go about their day, while a similar number of neighbors fall out of contact.

	The Watts-Strogatz model is often cited as the ideal small-world model, meaning that the distances (degrees of separation) between two random nodes . It also illustrates how random, non-systematic connections in a network actually lead to a significant decrease in the degrees of separation of the network (see Granovetter's <em>The Strength of Weak Ties</em>).
	<ol>
		<li>Look at the degree distribution. Does there appear to be any hubs? (Try lowering the <em>Rewiring probability</em>. What do you notice?) Does it appear to be <strong>scale-free</strong> at all?</li>
		<li>How clustered does the network seem? What is the highest <strong>clustering coefficient</strong> you 
			can get with <strong>50 nodes</strong>?</li>
		<li>What is the smallest <strong>average degrees of separation</strong> you can get? More specifically, how does changing the numbers of strong ties and weak ties affect the average distance of the network? Is it appropriate that this is often called a "small-world" network?</li>
