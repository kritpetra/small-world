	<h3>Barabasi-Albert Model</h3>
<p class='model_description'>	
	A group of people walk one by one into a networking event. As each person walks into the room, they exchange contact information with one or two people and continues mingling. As the room gets more crowded, each new person notices how certain individuals are approached more often, and so are more likely to seize the networking opportunity and also give them <emph>their</emph> contact information. At the end of the event, a small handful of people were able to connect with a lot of people, while the rest has only talked to one or two.

	The key feature of the model is its ability to produce <strong>hubs</strong>, or actors with significantly more connections than the average.
	<ol>
		<li>Look at the degree distribution. How does the shape differ from the other models? Does it appear to be a 
			<strong>scale-free</strong> network?</li>
		<li>What is the highest <strong>clustering coefficient</strong> you 
			can get with <strong>50 nodes</strong>? How does this compare with 
			other models?</li>
		<li>What is the smallest <strong>average degrees of separation</strong> you can get? Again, how does this compare with other models?</li>
