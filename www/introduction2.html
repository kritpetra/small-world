	<h3>Scale-free</h3>
		In social networks, there are always a few people whose role are 
		<strong>hubs</strong>, where they are connected to a much larger 
		amount of people than average. On a <strong>degree distribution 
		graph </strong>, this would appear as a nice power curve: <br/>

		Notice that while most of the points have 3 to 6 connections, the 
		hubs have upwards of 20! This property is called <strong>scale-free</strong>.
