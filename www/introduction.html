<h3>Why random graphs?</h3>
<p>	
	Researchers working in social network analysis, studying the different properties of social networks, have to work with questions such as: 
	<ul>
		<li>What actor seems to be the most important node?</li>
		<li>What happens to the network if that particular node is removed?</li>
		<li>What are the roles that each of the nodes play in the network?</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	One major problem with these questions is that answering them gets progressive 
	harder to do as the size of the network increases. Therefore, <strong>random 
	graph models</strong> provide a very robust way of examining these network 
	properties, as their properties can be easily manipulated and the mathematics 
	behind them can be easily calculated.
</p>
<p>
	However, real-world social networks proves to be much harder to represent 
	accurately than our current mathematical algorithms can handle! Several 
	different models of building social networks exist, each of which exhibit 
	different properties. In this app, we will be exploring the most commonly-used 
	algorithms for creating random graphs, its properties, advantages, and 
	disadvantages in representing real-world social networks.

<h3>Properties of Social Networks</h3>

<p>
	Real-life social networks exhibit three main properties:
	
	<strong><ol>
		<li>Scale-free</li>
		<li>High degree of clustering</li>
		<li>Low degree of separation</li>
	</ol></strong>
	An explanation of each property will be presented in the next pages.
