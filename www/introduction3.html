	<h3>High degree of clustering</h3>
		As human beings, we do not have the mental capacity to know everyone 
		on a personal level! Therefore, we form smaller social circles, 
		or <strong>clusters</strong>, where most everybody shares a connection 
		with each other. This property is called <strong>clustering</strong>, 
		and it is often measured by the <strong>clustering coefficient</strong>: 
		the closer the clustering coefficient is to 1, the more clustered people are. <br/>

	<h3>Low degree of separation</h3>
		As shown in Milgram's famous Small World experiment, real social 
		networks tend to have surprisingly small degrees of separation. 
		In other words, if you pick any two people in the world at random, 
		chances are that they could be connected to each other within 6 
		intermediaries! This number is called the <strong>distance</strong>,
		or the <strong>degrees of separation</strong>.
