<h3>Erdos-Renyi Model</h3>

<p class='model_description'>	
	You find yourself in a room of people. Bewildered, you all walk around aimlessly, 
	forming connections with random people as you walk past. After some time, the 
	door opens and everybody shuffles out.
</p>

<p>
	This model, of course, while simple and easy to visualize, is problematic 
	in that it does not adequately represent any aspect of real-world social 
	networks. 
	<ol>
		<li>Look at the degree distribution. Does it appear to be a 
			<strong>scale-free</strong> network?</li>
		<li>What is the highest <strong>clustering coefficient</strong> you 
			can get with <strong>50 nodes</strong>? How does this compare with 
			other models? Does this surprise you?</li>
		<li>What about the smallest <strong>average degrees of separation</strong>? Again, how does this compare with other models?</li>
	</ol>
