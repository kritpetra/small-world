	<h3>Stochastic Block Model</h3><br/>
<p class='model_description'>	
	Once again you find yourself in a room together with a group of people. In the room with you this time, however, are some people you already know. You make a beeline straight towards them. You notice that the strangers are doing the same, forming distinct groups of acquaintances. You consider walking around the whole room making new connections with anyone who happens to walk by you. But of course, you'd much rather prefer to stay with your own group of friends.

	This model attempts to combine the randomness of multiple Erdos-Renyi graphs with the weak ties found in the Watts-Strogatz model. The shape of the network may seem especially reminiscent of a social network where cliques are a prominent organizing structure.

		<li>Are there any noticeable <strong>hubs</strong> in the network?</li>
		<li>What seems to be the main factor behind the network's <strong>clustering coefficient</strong>?</li>
		<li>How does the <strong>average degrees of separation</strong> compare to other models? Does this make sense? Compared with the Watts-Strogatz model, what seems to be the most important element of a small-world network?</li>
